## Hello! Iâ€™m Victoria Drake. ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a software developer at ðŸ’œ and Director of Engineering at work. I build my skill stack in public and share open source knowledge through the words Iâ€™ve written on [victoria.dev](https://victoria.dev). I hope to encourage people to learn openly and fearlessly, with wild child-like abandon.

âš¡ Fun fact: Agent Coulson was not supposed to reappear past the first Iron Man film
